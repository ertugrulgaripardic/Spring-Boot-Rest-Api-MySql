As a dedicated Java Developer with over 2 years of experience, I specialize in building robust microservices and API-driven applications using Java, Spring Boot, and modern software development practices. My expertise spans across containerized environments with Docker and Kubernetes, and I have a deep understanding of microservices architecture and API design patterns. I am skilled in integrating systems using frameworks like Apache Camel, and proficient in working with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, and MySQL, utilizing Hibernate, JDBC, and ORM technologies. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with cloud technologies, including AWS serverless components (Lambda, Step Functions), and I am familiar with API management tools like APIGEE. I am proficient in deployment automation with Jenkins, Agile methodologies, and using tools like Jira and Confluence for sprint management. My experience also extends to working with MVC design patterns, document description languages like JSON and XML, and developing web services with JEE/Java/Spring. With strong problem-solving skills and a passion for continuous learning, I am committed to delivering scalable, high-quality solutions in dynamic and collaborative environments.
